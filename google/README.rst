Google Protocol Buffer Library
==============================

The code in this directory is copied from an installation of Google's protobuf_
library, and is subject to the terms of the `New BSD License`_ as outlined on
their repository. It is included here to enable support for protocol buffers on
`Google App Engine`_, where platform `support for protocol buffers`_ is still an
outstanding issue.
